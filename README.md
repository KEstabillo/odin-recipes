# odin-recipes
This project is the first project related to The Odin Project.  So far, we have covered the basics of HTML and will apply what I have learned into this project. The assignment is as follows:

1. Initial Structure

The initial structure is to create an index file and populate it with the boilerplate HTML file, adding a header called "Odin Recipes" to the body.

2. Recipe Page

Here, I will create a new directory in the main directory "odin-recipes" called "recipes". In this directory, I will use the heading as the name of the recipe and link it to the main index HTML using the anchor and href.

3. Recipe Page Content

The recipe page will have the following:

An image of the finished dish under the heading. (images can be found wherever) 

Under the image, there will be a description heading as well as a paragraph describing the recipe.

Under the description, add "Ingredients" heading followed by an unordered list.

4. Add more recipes

Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page.

Reflection:
This project did not take long to do, about 1-2 hours. I felt that it was a good way for me to practice all of the HTML commands such as lists, images, and using the anchor and href effectively. I do not know enough to make the site look better, which is what I will learn in the future. I was also able to use git efficiently, focusing on making the commit messages useful in what I added.
